## Description

The Course Enrollment System is a Java-based console application designed to manage student registrations and course enrollments. It provides a simple and user-friendly interface where students can create accounts, securely log in, browse available courses, enroll or drop courses, and manage their account settings. The system emphasizes data persistence using a CSV file for storing user credentials and enrollment data, ensuring all changes are saved between sessions.
